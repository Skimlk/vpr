# Virtual Position Resector

The **Virtual Position Resector** is a geolocation project that leverages surveying techniques to determine the geographical position of an image based on known reference points. Whether you're analyzing landscapes, historical photos, or remote areas, this tool empowers you to connect visual data with geographic coordinates.

## Key Features

- **Image Geolocation:** Pinpoint the approximate location where an image was taken.
- **Surveying Accuracy:** Utilize professional surveying techniques like resection for precise calculations.
- **Easy to Use:** A user-friendly interface for uploading images and entering reference points.

## How It Works

1. **Select Your Image:** Upload the image you want to geolocate.
2. **Choose Reference Points:** Identify at least two distinct points within the image with known real-world coordinates.
3. **Input Coordinates:** Enter the latitude and longitude of the reference points.

The resection technique is then applied to calculate the camera's position when the image was captured.
